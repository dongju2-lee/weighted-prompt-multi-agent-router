## üéØ Abstract

The Weighted Prompt Multi-Agent Router is an innovative system that **injects data-driven routing ratios directly into prompts to assist supervisor agent routing decisions**.

While traditional multi-agent systems require comprehensive agent descriptions in supervisor prompts, our system provides statistical ratios extracted from historical routing data along with simple agent roles. This dramatically reduces token usage while enabling data-driven accurate routing. Furthermore, simple weight parameter adjustments allow immediate implementation of real-time A/B testing, new agent deployment, and deprecated agent removal without system restarts, maximizing operational flexibility in production environments. The benefits become particularly pronounced in large-scale multi-agent environments with 100+ agents.

**Core Innovations:**
- üìä **Data-Driven Ratio Calculation**: Extract agent-specific routing ratios from historical patterns in vector databases
- üéØ **Prompt Enhancement**: Direct injection of calculated ratios into supervisor agent prompts as routing hints  
- ‚ö° **Instant Control**: Real-time routing ratio changes and immediate system behavior control through weight adjustments alone

This approach enables accurate routing and flexible control while maintaining token efficiency in large-scale multi-agent systems.

## üèÉ Version 2.0 Major Innovations

### 1. Complete Dynamic Pattern Learning
- **Real Data Storage**: All routing selections stored in `routing_history.json`
- **Automatic Transition**: Auto-switch from mock to real data after 5+ actual selections
- **Continuous Learning**: Pattern updates with every selection, reflecting user preference changes over time

### 2. Gemini Structured Output
- **Pydantic Models**: Structured response format eliminates 100% of parsing errors
- **Stable Routing**: Complete prevention of system failures due to text parsing errors
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Guaranteed stable agent selection in production environments

### 3. Real-time Weight Management
- **API-based Adjustment**: Real-time weight changes through REST API
- **Environment Variable Support**: Default weight configuration via `.env` file
- **Immediate Application**: Weight changes applied instantly without system restart

### 4. Comprehensive Monitoring System
- **Statistics Endpoint**: Real-time routing statistics via `/routing-stats`
- **History Query**: Recent routing record analysis via `/routing-history`
- **Health Check**: System status monitoring via `/health`
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed metrics including response time, confidence scores, attempt counts

## üí° Motivation

### The Problem with Traditional Multi-Agent Routing

Traditional multi-agent systems face significant challenges as they scale:

1. **Token Inefficiency**: Systems with 100+ agents require enormous prompts containing all agent descriptions
2. **Cost Explosion**: Wrong agent selection in large systems leads to substantial computational waste  
3. **Limited A/B Testing**: Real-time agent deployment requires system restarts and prompt modifications
4. **Deprecation Management**: Removing agents from production requires complex system changes

### Our Solution

The Weighted Prompt Multi-Agent Router solves these problems by:
- Using historical routing patterns instead of comprehensive agent descriptions
- Enabling real-time A/B testing through weight adjustments
- Providing smooth agent deprecation with traffic gradual reduction
- Working effectively with lower-performance LLMs

## üîÑ System Flow

### 1. Historical Pattern Analysis
```python
def get_routing_recommendation(user_query, similarity_threshold=0.7):
    # Embed query into vector space
    query_embedding = embed_query(user_query)
    
    # Search for similar historical queries
    similar_traces = vector_db.similarity_search(
        query_embedding, 
        top_k=100,
        threshold=similarity_threshold
    )
    
    # Calculate agent routing ratios
    agent_counts = {}
    total_traces = len(similar_traces)
    
    for trace in similar_traces:
        agent = trace['routed_agent']
        agent_counts[agent] = agent_counts.get(agent, 0) + 1
    
    base_ratios = {
        agent: count / total_traces 
        for agent, count in agent_counts.items()
    }
    
    return base_ratios, total_traces
```

### 2. Weight Application and Normalization
```python
def apply_weights_and_normalize(base_ratios, agent_weights):
    # Apply user-defined weights
    weighted_ratios = {}
    for agent, ratio in base_ratios.items():
        weight = agent_weights.get(agent, 1.0)
        weighted_ratios[agent] = ratio * weight
    
    # Renormalize to 100%
    total_weighted = sum(weighted_ratios.values())
    
    if total_weighted > 0:
        normalized_ratios = {
            agent: (ratio / total_weighted) * 100
            for agent, ratio in weighted_ratios.items()
        }
    else:
        normalized_ratios = {}
    
    return normalized_ratios
```

### 3. Enhanced Supervisor Prompt Generation
```python
def generate_supervisor_prompt(user_query, normalized_ratios, total_traces):
    historical_context = f"""
Historical Analysis Results:
- Referenced {total_traces} similar query data points
- Past routing patterns:
"""
    
    for agent, percentage in normalized_ratios.items():
        historical_context += f"  ‚Ä¢ {agent}: {percentage:.1f}%\n"
    
    supervisor_prompt = f"""
User Query: "{user_query}"

{historical_context}

Based on this historical data, select the most appropriate agent.
Consider past patterns while analyzing the specific context of the current question.

Available Agents:
- Soccer Agent: Soccer, futsal, kickball related activities
- Basketball Agent: Basketball, 3x3 basketball, shooting practice related activities
- Baseball Agent: Baseball, softball, batting practice related activities
- Tennis Agent: Tennis, badminton, racket sports related activities

Provide the selected agent and reasoning for your choice.
"""
    
    return supervisor_prompt
```

## üìä Metadata Structure

Historical routing data is stored in the following format:

```json
{
  "trace_id": "trace_12345",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-26T03:02:00Z",
  "user_query": "I want to play soccer",
  "query_embedding": [0.1, 0.2, ...],
  "routed_agent": "soccer_agent",
  "agent_confidence": 0.85,
  "routing_weights": {
    "soccer_agent": 0.85,
    "basketball_agent": 0.12,
    "baseball_agent": 0.03
  },
  "response": "I recommend soccer! How about futsal or soccer matches at nearby soccer fields?",
  "response_embedding": [0.3, 0.4, ...],
  "execution_time": 1.2,
  "user_feedback": null,
  "session_id": "session_abc123"
}
```

## üèÉ Real Usage Scenarios

### Clear Query Processing
```
Input: "I want to play soccer"
‚Üí Soccer Agent selected (confidence: 0.90)
‚Üí "I recommend soccer! How about futsal or soccer matches at nearby soccer fields?"
```

### Ambiguous Query Processing
```
Input: "I'm bored"
‚Üí Pattern analysis (Baseball: 30%, Soccer: 25%, Basketball: 25%, Tennis: 20%)
‚Üí Baseball Agent selected (confidence: 0.20)
‚Üí "I recommend baseball! How about batting practice or catch at the batting cage?"
```

## üéõÔ∏è Use Cases
